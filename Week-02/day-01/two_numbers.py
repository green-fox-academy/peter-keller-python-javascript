# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
a=22
b=13
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
add = a  +b
print(add)
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
substracted = a - b
print(substracted)
# Print the result of 22 mutiplied by 13
multiply = a * b
print(multiply)
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
divide = a / b
print(divide)
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
divide = a // b
print(divide)
# Print the reminder of 22 divided by 13
divide = a % b
print(divide)
